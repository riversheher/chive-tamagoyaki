The Steam spring sale is upon us!  This event will run from **March 16th - March 23rd**. There are many games that are on sale at incredible prices.  Here are a few that I am buying, and some that I already own but recommend for others!

## 1. Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous

- **Discount: 70%**
- **Price: $CAD 17.99** ~~$CAD 59.99~~

### Description
If you enjoy roleplaying games, this one is one of the best.  This is an ambitious CRPG game that sees the main character thrust into the middle of a crisis between demons and the living world.  You can follow a variety of different paths, become evil and rule with an iron fist, or embrace life and freedom.  

There are many romance options for whatever gender your character may be, including same-sex romance options.  However don't expect romancing to be easy.  You will have to pay close attention to your companions, their interests, and their personalities.  Sometimes, you will be forced to make tough decisions, between the romancing of your choice, or your characters moral values.  There is a depth to the story that will have you thinking about it even in your time away from this game.

When it comes to character customization, Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is also quite unbeatable.  You have the choice between 25 classes, which all have sub classes.  You can multi-class, leveling your character down multiple trees, or you can go with some of the pre-made classes if you're not sure.  

### Peronal Experience
I have always enjoyed playing this game.  It has very high replay value.  Although with so much information, sometimes you may be tempted to look online for guides to help you play optimally.  I have fallen into this trap, and I don't recommend it.  To play optimally can be so complicated, taking away from the fun of roleplaying and getting your character into interesting situations.  This is a game I always come back to when I want to relax for a few hours.

### Summary
I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy story driven games.  This is a deep game with many character customization and romance options.  If you don't mind reading text/dialogue, and enjoy delving into a deep story, this is the game for you. 

## 2. Elder Scrolls Online

- **Discount: 70%**
- **Price: $CAD 7.49** ~~$CAD 24.99~~

### Description
An MMORPG set in the second era of Tamriel.  You will have access to many regions all across Tamriel, including your favourites that have made appearances in other Elder Scrolls games such as Skyrim, Morrowind, Cyrodil, but also includes others such as Elsewyr.  

This game allows any race to become a healer, dps, crafter, etc.  Your roleplay opportunities are practically unlimited.  The roleplaying community in this game is also massive, so if you enjoy writing stories with others, this might be just the game for you.  

Even though this game is an MMO, you won't find the quests to be lacking in story.  I actually have found these to be quite enjoyable.  The characters are well written and quirky.  You are able to immerse yourself in the world of ESO quite easily.  

You are not obligated to pay more after your first purchase.  However after you progress, you may want to purchase the DLC as well.  There is also a premium subscription that is vital for lifeskillers, since it gives you an extra inventory space just for crafting items.  However even if you don't buy anything, this game is still worth at least 100 hours of gameplay.

### Peronal Experience
I enjoy my time playing this game, although I mainly do so for its roleplaying value.  I also enjoy lifeskilling such as crafting and provisioning, and playing quests!  Like I said earlier, these can actually turn out to be quite interesting, and not the fetch quest after fetch quest you might be used to in other MMOs.

### Summary
A great MMO to get into in 2023, especially if you value roleplaying.  Although the monetization of the game may turn you off, I would recommend buying the base game.  At $CAD 7.49, you are really amazing value for how much content this game provides.

## 3. Shadowrun: Hong Kong


## 4. Sun Haven
