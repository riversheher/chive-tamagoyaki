This game also supports 8 player multiplayer!  Perfect for cute gaming time with friends ;).

### Why I Want to Buy
After watching the anime ["Farming Life in Another World"](https://myanimelist.net/anime/51462/Isekai_Nonbiri_Nouka?q=farming%20life%20in%20another%20world&cat=anime), my farming management itch has grown to an immense size.  I have really wanted to roleplay in a fantasy farming setting.  Sun Haven seems like exactly what I would be looking for! There are several aspects of "Sun Haven" that caught my interest and made me decide to buy the game:

- First, I love farming simulation games and the idea of building and upgrading my own farm generally. It's satisfying to see the fruits of my labor, and I appreciate that the game offers different paths to achieve that, depending on my play style.  
- Second, I'm intrigued by the RPG elements of the game, such as the ability to choose different roles and undertake quests. It adds depth and variety to the gameplay, and the fact that the quests can be completed in different ways, depending on your abilities, is a nice touch. You can be a miner, fisher, warrior, crafstman, or mage.  The roleplaying possibilities are endless!
- Third, I'm excited to explore the world and manage a farm with friends.  With 8 player multiplayer support, this makes multiplies the roleplaying opportunities with others too! You can have a much larger group play together than other games in this genre such as Stardew Valley.
- Fourth, the fact that the game offers nonviolent alternatives to overcome dangerous encounters is appealing to me. I'm not a big fan of combat-heavy games, so the fact that there are other ways to progress and beat the game is a plus.  Having the freedom to have different characters that can specialize in different things, while not having to sacrifice on content is very appealing.

### Summary
Overall, "Sun Haven" seems like a fun and engaging game that would appeal to those who enjoy farming simulations and RPGs, and who are looking for a game that offers a variety of gameplay options and nonviolent alternatives.  If you are a big fan of Stardew Valley, this game might be right up your alley.  This adds fantasy and questing elements that is absolutely perfect for cute e-girls and anime lovers.

## 4. Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous

{{< figure src="/images/Blog/steamspringsale/pwotr.jpg" title="" >}}

- **Discount: 70%**
- **Price: $CAD 17.99** ~~$CAD 59.99~~
- **Rating: 84% Positive**

[**Check it out here!**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184370/Pathfinder_Wrath_of_the_Righteous__Enhanced_Edition/)

### Description
If you enjoy roleplaying games, this one is one of the best.  This is an ambitious CRPG game that sees the main character thrust into the middle of a crisis between demons and the living world.  You can follow a variety of different paths, become evil and rule with an iron fist, or embrace life and freedom.  

There are many romance options for whatever gender your character may be, including same-sex romance options.  However don't expect romancing to be easy.  You will have to pay close attention to your companions, their interests, and their personalities.  Sometimes, you will be forced to make tough decisions, between the romancing of your choice, or your characters moral values.  There is a depth to the story that will have you thinking about it even in your time away from this game.

When it comes to character customization, Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is also quite unbeatable.  You have the choice between 25 classes, which all have sub classes.  You can multi-class, leveling your character down multiple trees, or you can go with some of the pre-made classes if you're not sure.  

### Peronal Experience
I have always enjoyed playing this game.  It has very high replay value.  Although with so much information, sometimes you may be tempted to look online for guides to help you play optimally.  I have fallen into this trap, and I don't recommend it.  To play optimally can be so complicated, taking away from the fun of roleplaying and getting your character into interesting situations.  This is a game I always come back to when I want to relax for a few hours.

### Summary
I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy story driven games.  This is a deep game with many character customization and romance options.  If you don't mind reading text/dialogue, and enjoy delving into a deep story, this is the game for you.
